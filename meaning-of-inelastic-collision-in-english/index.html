<p>A collision is inelastic if the kinetic energy is lost and converted into some other form of energy after the collision occurs. The collision between two bodies in which the kinetic energy of collision remains constant before and after collision is known as elastic collision.

Basically, the inelastic collision is the one in which the energy will definitely change and not be saved or conserved in such a case after a collision process. An inelastic collision is one where the momentum is conserved in the collision but the kinetic energy is not. The elastic collision has momentum and energy conserved, but inelastic has only momentum conserved, whereas the energy is lost in.</p>

It is defined as the ratio of the velocity of separation by the velocity of approach along the line of collision. Momentum remains conserved and kinetic energy initial is. Most collisions that occur every day are examples of an inelastic collision such as collision between two cars or a baseball hitting a bat.</p>
