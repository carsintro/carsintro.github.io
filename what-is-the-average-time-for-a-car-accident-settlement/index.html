What�s the Average Settlement for a Rear End Crash in California? From wakefordlaw.com
A month or two is the minimum time frame that you should expect when you file a car accident. Nonetheless, on average, it takes approximately 8 to 16 months from the date a case is started until a plaintiff receives a final settlement payment. Unfortunately, it is almost impossible to know exactly how long your claim will take because every accident and every client’s health is different. In many cases, the car accident settlement cases take up to two weeks if you have a successful appeal to the insurance company.
