Why You Need Car Insurance TechCabal From techcabal.com
If a friend caused an accident while driving your car, your insurance should pay out to cover the medical bills, lost wages, and property damage of the victims. When this happens and there is an accident that damages your vehicle, someone else’s vehicle, or someone else’s property, you could find yourself in a lot of hot water. You will get a fixed penalty fine of £300 and six points on your license and you could even face more serious charges. This timeframe can be anywhere from 24 hours to a few days.
