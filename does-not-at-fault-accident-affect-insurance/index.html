How Does Car Insurance Work When You Are Not At Fault No Fault From lasendadelabandono1.blogspot.com
The idea of being penalized for making claims is inaccurate, because all that is happening is that your risk level is being reassessed. Even if you aren�t at fault, if you have a history of accidents you may have an increase. If you�re in an accident, and it is your fault, your insurance rate will increase.but even if the accident was not your fault, your insurance rate may still increase. This, in turn, leads to reduced insurance rates.
