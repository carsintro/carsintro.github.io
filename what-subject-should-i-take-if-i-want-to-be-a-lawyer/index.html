The law keeps the world running in order. Prospective lawyers must undertake a series of steps to practice law, including completion of undergraduate and graduate degrees, examinations and licensing processes. Before law school, students must complete a bachelor’s degree in any subject (law isn’t an undergraduate degree), which takes four years. In order to become a lawyer, you must graduate from college and pass specific courses in law school.
